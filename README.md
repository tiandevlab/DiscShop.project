Entity Class Creation Details
Necessity:
The Album entity class is crucial for our project as it:

- Represents the core domain object of our music shop
- Facilitates Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with the database
- Serves as the foundation for album-related business logic

Process:

1. Identified essential attributes for the Album entity
2. Created the Album class with appropriate fields
3. Applied JPA annotations (@Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc.)
4. Implemented constructors, getters, and setters
5. Added toString() method for debugging purposes
